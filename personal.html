    <h2>What are programming languages?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    A programming language is the language that humans use to communicate with computers to carry out certain tasks. Java and python are two of the most popular programming languages, mostly due to that fact that they serve many universal purposes.
   </p>
    <h2>Similarities</h2>

    <p>Java and Python are similar in multiple ways. They follow similar conditional structure, logical operations, the main data types (string, int, float..), as well include object-oriented paradigms (more on this later). It is well known that if you know one of the languages, then learning the other is quite simple. The key difference between the two languages is related to principle of static and dynamic typing.</p>

      Java
    </h1>
      <p>

        Java is statically typed – meaning it requires the <strong><em>declaration</em></strong> of variables, prior to runtime. The declaration of variables makes it so the machine doesn’t have to interpret a values’ data type while running.
        Java code is compiled, which is one of the features that make it a faster language. Through compilation, the compiler takes the source code and translates it into machine language as binary code (consist of 1’s and 0’s) for your CPU to execute.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another aspect to consider is Java’s code structure. Java follows the object-oriented paradigm, meaning that it is based on the class-object system. Everything in Java is an object!
        For python coders, this is also a similar principle – everything in python is an object as well; but what makes java different is that <strong>all</strong> code must be written in this paradigm. A basic code structure in java is as followed:
        <br>
        <br>
          <img id="ex1" src="img/ex1.png" alt="example" align="top">
        Notice how all the code is in a class, and how that code is encased in curly brackets. Unlike python, java does not require the proper indentation of code, but rather the correct placement of curly brackets relative to the code. With the entirety of java code being in a class-methods structure; it is no surprise why many refer to this language as an Object-Oriented Language.
        <br>
        <br>
        But why should one even learn this language? Java has been around much longer than python, meaning that the internet is <strong>full</strong> of
        guides and resources to help you learn the language. Python also has an array of resources on the net, but compared to java - it does lack. This language is
        excellent for creating apps on mobile and web browsers, and even presents some data analysis and visualization competencies. Some famous apps built on this language include Spotify, Minecraft and Twitter.
        <br>
        <br>

        Now, should you consider learning this language first? Note that by learning java you’ll be introduced to the
        object-oriented paradigm which will be very helpful in learning other languages such as python to keep your code
        DRY. But a draw back of the java language is of course its
        complexity. Wrapping your head around classes and objects can be quite tricky, but of course once you do learn to
        understand, it’ll make your journey with languages much, much smoother. Another thing to note is that java is not
        all plain English. Python uses plain English to refer to its logical operators, but java uses symbols such as “&&”
        and “||” in logical operations.

      Python
    </h1>

      <p>
        It is no surprise that python is slowly surfacing as one of the most popular coding languages. With its code structure being similar to the English language, to the fact that its VERY beginner-friendly, makes it all the while worth the hype.
        <br>
        <br>
        Python is an interpreted language. Meaning that an interpreter executes the code line by line, instead of compiling and then having the code executed by the CPU. By executing the code line by line, variable declarations not required in python – but this line by line execution does make python a slower language Most of pythons logical operators are in the form of plane English: “and” ,”or” ,”in” .  Python does not require code to be formatted in the class system for the program to run, but it is compatible with procedural (functions), object-oriented (classes), and functional (pure functions) paradigms.
        <br>
        <br>
        Python has become popular among beginners because of its simplicity. Its code is indented and simple instructions are kept short. For example – to print out something in the terminal in java, you would have to call upon the Systems class, access the corresponding methods to print your statement; but in python, you simply use the key word, “print”.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is the case with receiving input as well. For java, you’d have to import the Scanner class, make a new object of the scanner class, and then declare the type of input your receiving (many more steps, but you get the idea), but in python, you only need to use the “input” statement to collect input from the user.
        <br>
        <br>
        One should also consider that python is THE language for data science. Python has a variety of modules which, like java can be accessed with the “import” key word. From NumPy, to Scikit learn – python provides some the most essential packages that are used by data scientist. Not only this, but python has many GUI modules such as pygame, tkinter and kivy (create apps for Ios and Samsung in PURE PYTHON with this module!!).
        Some famous programs built on the python language include: Netflix, Instagram and Pinterest.
